# Duck Code

This directory contains source and
object code files of DM2018W machine
code.  The source code is in an assembly
code format, .asm.  The object code is
in standard Duck Machine Object Code
format, .obj  (which is just a list of printed integers).   The .dasm format is an intermediate 
between .asm and .obj, with addresses of labels resolved.
